      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Kevin Salgado Antonio. I have been very passionate about
        coding since elementary school. In 4th grade, I was given an assignment
        on a website called
        <a href="https://code.org/" target="blank">Code.org</a>. When given the
        assignment, I quickly became really attached to it, finished the entire
        assignment in one day, and was really curious to learn more coding. As
        the years went by, I did different types of coding. I remember doing a
        project in middle school based on the game Ping Pong on an online
        website. As well as working on a group project with my classmates to
        learn how to program a robot and make it do things like move around,
        pick things up, and repeat certain actions with a given command. I'm
        really grateful to have been given the chance to experience coding at
        such a young age. It has really influenced my life and led me to where I
        am now. Before code became an aspiration, I was really into dinosaurs,
        like every other kid, and wanted to be a paleontologist. That dream
        quickly died after I was told that when I became a paleontologist, there
        would be no more fossils for me to dig up.

        Besides school, something I am really into is Pokémon. I find Pokémon to
        be such a fun and wonderful thing. Pokémon is a universe where anyone
        can aspire to be who they want to be by following their goals and with
        the help from friends and companions. I have learn many things from
        watching the show, but a main message that sticks out is to never give
        up on your goals, and to give it your very best. I try to live by that
        idea and try to never give up no matter how hard it get.
